sonar-jacococd-plugin
=====================

This is a extraction version of sonar-jacoco-plugin which enables comment directives offered by @mchr3k 's jacoco fork.  I made it separated from sonar-java so that there is no conflict between this one and the original sonar-jacococd-plugin. use it by set the coverage tool to "jacococd"
